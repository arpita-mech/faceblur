FaceBlurr: Real-Time Face Blurring using OpenCV and MediaPipe


Developed a real-time face blurring application that detects and obscures faces in live video feeds using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The system leverages MediaPipe's face detection model to identify faces accurately, then dynamically applies a blur effect to protect video privacy.

Features:
ðŸŽ¥ Live webcam video processing
ðŸ‘¤ Precise face detection with MediaPipe
ðŸ”³ Real-time face blurring for privacy protection
âš¡ Efficient performance on standard hardware

ðŸ’¼ Applications:
â€¢ Privacy protection in video conferencing
â€¢ Anonymizing faces in recorded footage
â€¢ Enhancing security in public surveillance
